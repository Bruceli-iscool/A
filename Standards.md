# The A language standards 

This is the standard for the A programming language and where it is headed. Most syntax rules should and will be described in this document. The document can and will be updated as the language continues to grow.

# Syntax

Syntax of the A programming lanugauge should and can be described by the following:

    Human readable lanugage that uses natural descriptions for lanuguage functions.
This list may better explain the syntax:

1. Human language lookalike. A should and will be readable and flow like a normal essay that your writing.
2. The only delimeters should be dots and spaces. 
3. Focus on what its goal is, an alternative to R, not a fancy language like C++, C, Python, Java, etc.

# Usage
Naming convention:

    camelCase over under_scores
    under_scores over ALLCAPS
    ALLCAPS over alllowercase
